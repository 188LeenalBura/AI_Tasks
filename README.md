# Python Tasks


- 📝 Basic Arithmetic Operations: A program that takes two numbers as input from the user and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

  
- 🔍 Palindrome Checker: A function that checks if a given string is a palindrome.

  
- 📁 File Handling: A script that reads a text file, counts the number of words, and writes the results to a new file.

 
- 📈 Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries: A program that stores student data (name, age, grades) in a dictionary and performs CRUD operations.

  
- 📊 Basic OOP (Object-Oriented Programming): A Student class with attributes for name, age, and grades, including methods to display details and calculate the average grade.

  
- 📡 API Request: A program that uses the requests library to fetch data from a public API (e.g. Weather API), parses and displays specific information.

 
 # API Development Task 📈

🎬 Movie Review Database API 🎥


📈 This task involves creating a RESTful API using Flask and designing a frontend interface to interact with the API. The API performs CRUD operations and is built around a movie review database.

This task involves creating a RESTful API using Flask to manage a movie review database. The API performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to:

- 📝 Create new movie reviews
- 📊 Read existing movie reviews
- 📝 Update movie reviews
- 🚮 Delete movie reviews

*API Response 📊*
The API responds with JSON data, including:

- Movie year
- Movie genre
- Movie country
- Movie rating (1-5 stars)
- Review text
- Reviewer name
