 # API Development Task 📈

🎬 Movie Review Database API 🎥


📈 This task involves creating a RESTful API using Flask and designing a frontend interface to interact with the API. The API performs CRUD operations and is built around a movie review database.

This task involves creating a RESTful API using Flask to manage a movie review database. The API performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing users to:
