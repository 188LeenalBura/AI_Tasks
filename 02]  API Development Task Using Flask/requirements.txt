  **Requirements (`requirements.txt`)**

This file contains the dependencies required to run the app.

```text
Flask==2.2.2
```

### Setting Up the Environment:

1. Install the required Python dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Place the `app.py`, `movies.json`, and `templates/index.html` (containing your HTML code) into the appropriate directories.

3. Run the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

This setup will run the Flask app and serve the HTML interface for the movie review database, handle filtering of movies, and allow users to submit reviews.
